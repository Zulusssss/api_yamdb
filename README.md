# Group project on the course "API: program interaction interface" - YaMDb

### Description
The YaMDb project collects user reviews of works. The works themselves are not stored in YaMDb, you cannot watch a movie or listen to music here.
The works are divided into categories such as "Books", "Movies", "Music". For example, in the "Books" category there may be works "Winnie the Pooh and everything-everything-everything" and "Martian Chronicles", and in the "Music" category there is the song "Recently" by the group "Beetles" and the second suite by Bach. The list of categories can be expanded (for example, you can add the category "Fine Art" or "Jewelry"). 
A work can be assigned a genre from the preset list (for example, "Fairy Tale", "Rock" or "Arthouse"). 
Only the administrator can add works, categories and genres.
Grateful or outraged users leave text reviews for the works and give the work a rating in the range from one to ten (an integer); an average rating of the work is formed from user ratings ‚Äî a rating (an integer). The user can leave only one review per work.
Users can leave comments on reviews.
Only authenticated users can add reviews, comments, and ratings.
